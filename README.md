we use jekyll to maintain our website. Feel free to send us a pull request.


How to edit
-----------

If you want to see your changes before creating the pull request, either run jekyll locally or head over to `your-username.github.io/biojs.github.io` (after the fork it can take up to ten minutes for this site to appear).

Github automatically runs Jekyll on every commit.


Run jekyll on your machine
--------------------------

You can start a local server with `jekyll serve -w`.
